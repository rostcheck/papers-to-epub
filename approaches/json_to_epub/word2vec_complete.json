The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set.

      "content": "Many current NLP systems and techniques treat words as atomic units - there is no notion of similarity between words, as these are represented as indices in a vocabulary. This choice has several good reasons - simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of data outperform complex systems trained on less data. An example is the popular N-gram model used for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available data (trillions of words [stupid-backoff]). However, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. For example, the amount of relevant in-domain data for automatic speech recognition is limited - the performance is usually dominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (often just millions of words). In machine translation, the existing corpora for many languages contain only a few billions of words or less. Thus, there are situations where simple scaling up of the basic techniques will not result in any significant progress, and we have to focus on more advanced techniques. With progress of machine learning techniques in recent years, it has become possible to train more complex models on much larger data set, and they typically outperform the simple models. Probably the most successful concept is to use distributed representations of words [Hinton]. For example, neural network based language models significantly outperform N-gram models [Bengio, Schwenk, MikolovIS2011].",

          "content": "The main goal of this paper is to introduce techniques that can be used for learning high-quality word vectors from huge data sets with billions of words, and with millions of words in the vocabulary. As far as we know, none of the previously proposed architectures has been successfully trained on more than a few hundred of millions of words, with a modest dimensionality of the word vectors between 50 - 100. We use recently proposed techniques for measuring the quality of the resulting vector representations, with the expectation that not only will similar words tend to be close to each other, but that words can have {bf multiple degrees of similarity] [NAACL1]. This has been observed earlier in the context of inflectional languages - for example, nouns can have multiple word endings, and if we search for similar words in a subspace of the original vector space, it is possible to find words that have similar endings [dip, Mikolov]. Somewhat surprisingly, it was found that similarity of word representations goes beyond simple syntactic regularities. Using a word offset technique where simple algebraic operations are performed on the word vectors, it was shown for example that <em><em>vector</em>(\"King\") - <em>vector</em>(\"Man\") + <em>vector</em>(\"Woman\")</em> results in a vector that is closest to the vector representation of the word <em>Queen</em> [NAACL1]. In this paper, we try to maximize accuracy of these vector operations by developing new model architectures that preserve the linear regularities among words. We design a new comprehensive test set for measuring both syntactic and semantic regularitiesfootnote{The test set is available at url{www.fit.vutbr.cz/ imikolov/rnnlm/word-test.v1.txt]], and show that many such regularities can be learned with high accuracy. Moreover, we discuss how training time and accuracy depends on the dimensionality of the word vectors and on the amount of the training data.",

          "content": "Representation of words as continuous vectors has a long history [Hinton, BPTT, Elman]. A very popular model architecture for estimating neural network language model (NNLM) was proposed in [Bengio], where a feedforward neural network with a linear projection layer and a non-linear hidden layer was used to learn jointly the word vector representation and a statistical language model. This work has been followed by many others. Another interesting architecture of NNLM was presented in [dip, Mikolov], where the word vectors are first learned using neural network with a single hidden layer. The word vectors are then used to train the NNLM. Thus, the word vectors are learned even without constructing the full NNLM. In this work, we directly extend this architecture, and focus just on the first step where the word vectors are learned using a simple model. It was later shown that the word vectors can be used to significantly improve and simplify many NLP applications [Collobert1, Collobert2, Turian]. Estimation of the word vectors itself was performed using different model architectures and trained on various corpora [Collobert1, Turian, Mnih, thesis, Huang], and some of the resulting word vectors were made available for future research and comparisonfootnote{url{http://ronan.collobert.com/senna/] url{http://metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs/] url{http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/ imikolov/rnnlm/] url{http://ai.stanford.edu/ ehhuang/] ]. However, as far as we know, these architectures were significantly more computationally expensive for training than the one proposed in [dip], with the exception of certain version of log-bilinear model where diagonal weight matrices are used [Mnih].",

In this paper, we focus on distributed representations of words learned by neural networks, as it was previously shown that they perform significantly better than LSA for preserving linear regularities among words [NAACL1, NAACL2]; LDA moreover becomes computationally very expensive on large data sets. Similar to [ASRU], to compare different model architectures we define first the computational complexity of a model as the number of parameters that need to be accessed to fully train the model. Next, we will try to maximize the accuracy, while minimizing the computational complexity. For all the following models, the training complexity is proportional to where $E$ is number of the training epochs, $T$ is the number of the words in the training set and $Q$ is defined further for each model architecture. Common choice is $E = 3 - 50$ and $T$ up to one billion. All models are trained using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation [BPTT].",

          "level": 2,
          "content": "The probabilistic feedforward neural network language model has been proposed in [Bengio]. It consists of input, projection, hidden and output layers. At the input layer, $N$ previous words are encoded using 1-of-$V$ coding, where $V$ is size of the vocabulary. The input layer is then projected to a projection layer $P$ that has dimensionality $N times D$, using a shared projection matrix. As only $N$ inputs are active at any given time, composition of the projection layer is a relatively cheap operation. The NNLM architecture becomes complex for computation between the projection and the hidden layer, as values in the projection layer are dense. For a common choice of $N = 10$, the size of the projection layer ($P$) might be 500 to 2000, while the hidden layer size $H$ is typically 500 to 1000 units. Moreover, the hidden layer is used to compute probability distribution over all the words in the vocabulary, resulting in an output layer with dimensionality $V$. Thus, the computational complexity per each training example is where the dominating term is $H times V$. However, several practical solutions were proposed for avoiding it; either using hierarchical versions of the softmax [Morin, Mnih, ASRU], or avoiding normalized models completely by using models that are not normalized during training [Collobert1, Huang]. With binary tree representations of the vocabulary, the number of output units that need to be evaluated can go down to around $log_{2](V)$. Thus, most of the complexity is caused by the term $N times D times H$. In our models, we use hierarchical softmax where the vocabulary is represented as a Huffman binary tree. This follows previous observations that the frequency of words works well for obtaining classes in neural net language models [MikolovICASSP2011]. Huffman trees assign short binary codes to frequent words, and this further reduces the number of output units that need to be evaluated: while balanced binary tree would require $log_{2](V)$ outputs to be evaluated, the Huffman tree based hierarchical softmax requires only about $log_{2](Unigram_perplexity(V))$. For example when the vocabulary size is one million words, this results in about two times speedup in evaluation. While this is not crucial speedup for neural network LMs as the computational bottleneck is in the $N times D times H$ term, we will later propose architectures that do not have hidden layers and thus depend heavily on the efficiency of the softmax normalization.",

The RNN model does not have a projection layer; only input, hidden and output layer. What is special for this type of model is the recurrent matrix that connects hidden layer to itself, using time-delayed connections. This allows the recurrent model to form some kind of short term memory, as information from the past can be represented by the hidden layer state that gets updated based on the current input and the state of the hidden layer in the previous time step. The complexity per training example of the RNN model is where the word representations $D$ have the same dimensionality as the hidden layer $H$. Again, the term $H times V$ can be efficiently reduced to $H times log_{2](V)$ by using hierarchical softmax. Most of the complexity then comes from $H times H$.",

The new architectures directly follow those proposed in our earlier work [dip, Mikolov], where it was found that neural network language model can be successfully trained in two steps: first, continuous word vectors are learned using simple model, and then the N-gram NNLM is trained on top of these distributed representations of words. While there has been later substantial amount of work that focuses on learning word vectors, we consider the approach proposed in [dip] to be the simplest one.

We call this architecture a bag-of-words model as the order of words in the history does not influence the projection. Furthermore, we also use words from the future; we have obtained the best performance on the task introduced in the next section by building a log-linear classifier with four future and four history words at the input, where the training criterion is to correctly classify the current (middle) word. Training complexity is then We denote this model further as CBOW, as unlike standard bag-of-words model, it uses continuous distributed representation of the context.

More precisely, we use each current word as an input to a log-linear classifier with continuous projection layer, and predict words within a certain range before and after the current word. We found that increasing the range improves quality of the resulting word vectors, but it also increases the computational complexity. Since the more distant words are usually less related to the current word than those close to it, we give less weight to the distant words by sampling less from those words in our training examples. The training complexity of this architecture is proportional to where $C$ is the maximum distance of the words. Thus, if we choose $C=5$, for each training word we will select randomly a number $R$ in range $<1 ; C>$, and then use $R$ words from history and $R$ words from the future of the current word as correct labels. This will require us to do $R times 2$ word classifications, with the current word as input, and each of the $R + R$ words as output. In the following experiments, we use $C=10$.",

      "content": "To compare the quality of different versions of word vectors, previous papers typically use a table showing example words and their most similar words, and understand them intuitively. Although it is easy to show that word <em>France</em> is similar to <em>Italy</em> and perhaps some other countries, it is much more challenging when subjecting those vectors in a more complex similarity task, as follows. We follow previous observation that there can be many different types of similarities between words, for example, word <em>big</em> is similar to <em>bigger</em> in the same sense that <em>small</em> is similar to <em>smaller</em>. Example of another type of relationship can be word pairs <em>big - biggest</em> and <em>small - smallest</em> [NAACL1]. We further denote two pairs of words with the same relationship as a question, as we can ask: \"What is the word that is similar to <em>small</em> in the same sense as <em>biggest</em> is similar to <em>big</em>?\" Somewhat surprisingly, these questions can be answered by performing simple algebraic operations with the vector representation of words. To find a word that is similar to <em>small</em> in the same sense as <em>biggest</em> is similar to <em>big</em>, we can simply compute vector $X = <em>vector</em>(\"biggest\") - <em>vector</em>(\"big\") + <em>vector</em>(\"small\")$. Then, we search in the vector space for the word closest to $X$ measured by cosine distance, and use it as the answer to the question (we discard the input question words during this search). When the word vectors are well trained, it is possible to find the correct answer (word $smallest$) using this method. Finally, we found that when we train high dimensional word vectors on a large amount of data, the resulting vectors can be used to answer very subtle semantic relationships between words, such as a city and the country it belongs to, e.g. France is to Paris as Germany is to Berlin. Word vectors with such semantic relationships could be used to improve many existing NLP applications, such as machine translation, information retrieval and question answering systems, and may enable other future applications yet to be invented.",

Two examples from each category are shown in Table [ref-tab1]. Overall, there are 8869 semantic and 10675 syntactic questions. The questions in each category were created in two steps: first, a list of similar word pairs was created manually. Then, a large list of questions is formed by connecting two word pairs. For example, we made a list of 68 large American cities and the states they belong to, and formed about 2.5K questions by picking two word pairs at random. We have included in our test set only single token words, thus multi-word entities are not present (such as <em>New York</em>). We evaluate the overall accuracy for all question types, and for each question type separately (semantic, syntactic). Question is assumed to be correctly answered only if the closest word to the vector computed using the above method is exactly the same as the correct word in the question; synonyms are thus counted as mistakes. This also means that reaching 100 be impossible, as the current models do not have any input information about word morphology. However, we believe that usefulness of the word vectors for certain applications should be positively correlated with this accuracy metric. Further progress can be achieved by incorporating information about structure of words, especially for the syntactic questions.",

Clearly, we are facing time constrained optimization problem, as it can be expected that both using more data and higher dimensional word vectors will improve the accuracy. To estimate the best choice of model architecture for obtaining as good as possible results quickly, we have first evaluated models trained on subsets of the training data, with vocabulary restricted to the most frequent 30k words. The results using the CBOW architecture with different choice of word vector dimensionality and increasing amount of the training data are shown in Table [ref-Acc1]. It can be seen that after some point, adding more dimensions or adding more training data provides diminishing improvements. So, we have to increase both vector dimensionality and the amount of the training data together. While this observation might seem trivial, it must be noted that it is currently popular to train word vectors on relatively large amounts of data, but with insufficient size (such as 50 - 100). Given Equation [ref-eq1], increasing amount of training data twice results in about the same increase of computational complexity as increasing vector size twice. For the experiments reported in Tables [ref-Acc1] and [ref-Acc2], we used three training epochs with stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation.

In the further experiments, we use full set of questions in the new Semantic-Syntactic Word Relationship test set, i.e. unrestricted to the 30k vocabulary. We also include results on a test set introduced in [NAACL1] that focuses on syntactic similarity between wordsfootnote{We thank Geoff Zweig for providing us the test set.]. The training data consists of several LDC corpora and is described in detail in [ASRU] (320M words, 82K vocabulary). We used these data to provide a comparison to a previously trained recurrent neural network language model that took about 8 weeks to train on a single CPU. We trained a feedforward NNLM with the same number of 640 hidden units using the DistBelief parallel training [DistBelief], using a history of 8 previous words (thus, the NNLM has more parameters than the RNNLM, as the projection layer has size $640 times 8$). In Table [ref-Acc0], it can be seen that the word vectors from the RNN (as used in [NAACL1]) perform well mostly on the syntactic questions. The NNLM vectors perform significantly better than the RNN - this is not surprising, as the word vectors in the RNNLM are directly connected to a non-linear hidden layer. The CBOW architecture works better than the NNLM on the syntactic tasks, and about the same on the semantic one. Finally, the Skip-gram architecture works slightly worse on the syntactic task than the CBOW model (but still better than the NNLM), and much better on the semantic part of the test than all the other models. Next, we evaluated our models trained using one CPU only and compared the results against publicly available word vectors. The comparison is given in Table [ref-Acc2]. The CBOW model was trained on subset of the Google News data in about a day, while training time for the Skip-gram model was about three days. For experiments reported further, we used just one training epoch (again, we decrease the learning rate linearly so that it approaches zero at the end of training). Training a model on twice as much data using one epoch gives comparable or better results than iterating over the same data for three epochs, as is shown in Table [ref-Acc3], and provides additional small speedup.",

We observed that it is possible to train high quality word vectors using very simple model architectures, compared to the popular neural network models (both feedforward and recurrent). Because of the much lower computational complexity, it is possible to compute very accurate high dimensional word vectors from a much larger data set. Using the DistBelief distributed framework, it should be possible to train the CBOW and Skip-gram models even on corpora with one trillion words, for basically unlimited size of the vocabulary. That is several orders of magnitude larger than the best previously published results for similar models. An interesting task where the word vectors have recently been shown to significantly outperform the previous state of the art is the SemEval-2012 Task 2 [Jurgens]. The publicly available RNN vectors were used together with other techniques to achieve over 50 The neural network based word vectors were previously applied to many other NLP tasks, for example sentiment analysis [sentiment] and paraphrase detection [paraphrase]. It can be expected that these applications can benefit from the model architectures described in this paper. Our ongoing work shows that the word vectors can be successfully applied to automatic extension of facts in Knowledge Bases, and also for verification of correctness of existing facts. Results from machine translation experiments also look very promising. In the future, it would be also interesting to compare our techniques to Latent Relational Analysis [Turney] and others.

We also expect that high quality word vectors will become an important building block for future NLP applications.",

The training speed is significantly higher than reported earlier in this paper, i.e. it is in the order of billions of words per hour for typical hyperparameter choices. We also published more than 1.4 million vectors that represent named entities, trained on more than 100 billion words. Some of our follow-up work will be published in an upcoming NIPS 2013 paper [NIPS2013]. bibliography{strings,refs]",
