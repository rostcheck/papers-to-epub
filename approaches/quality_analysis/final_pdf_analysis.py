        abstract = """Recently, Sakana.ai introduced the AI Scientist, a system claiming to automate the entire research lifecycle and conduct research autonomously, a concept we term Artificial Research Intelligence (ARI). Achieving ARI would be a major milestone toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and a prerequisite to achieving Super Intelligence. The AI Scientist received much attention in the academic and broader AI community. A thorough evaluation of the AI Scientist, however, had not yet been conducted. 

We evaluated the AI Scientist and found several critical shortcomings. The system's literature review process is inadequate, relying on simplistic keyword searches rather than profound synthesis, which leads to poor novelty assessments. In our experiments, several generated research ideas were incorrectly classified as novel, including well-established concepts such as micro-batching for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The AI Scientist also lacks robustness in experiment executionâ€”five out of twelve proposed experiments (42%) failed due to coding errors, and those that did run often produced logically flawed or misleading results.

The generated manuscripts were poorly substantiated, with a median of just five citations per paperâ€”most of which were outdated (only five out of 34 citations were from 2020 or later). Structural errors were frequent, including missing figures, repeated sections, and placeholder text such as "Conclusions Here". Hallucinated numerical results were contained in several manuscripts, undermining the reliability of its outputs.

Despite its limitations, the AI Scientist represents a significant leap forward in research automation. It produces complete research manuscripts with minimal human intervention, challenging conventional expectations of AI-generated scientific work. While the quality of its manuscripts currently aligns with that of an unmotivated undergraduate student rushing to meet a deadline, this level of autonomy in research generation is remarkable. More strikingly, it achieves this at an unprecedented speed and cost efficiencyâ€”our analysis indicates that generating a full research paper costs only $6â€“$15, with just 3.5 hours of human involvement."""
