## Conclusion

The LaTeX to XML conversion shows **moderate success** with good metadata preservation and basic structural conversion, but **critical failures** in essential academic document components. The current 55% quality score indicates the document is **not ready for ePub production** without significant improvements.

**Primary blockers for ePub readiness:**
1. Missing all tables (8 tables with research results)
2. Missing all references (32 scholarly citations)
3. Missing all citation links (51 citations)
4. Mathematical content degraded to placeholders

**Recommended approach:**
1. Address critical issues first (tables, references, citations, figures)
2. Implement proper mathematical content conversion
3. Fix structural hierarchy issues
4. Validate against schema and test ePub generation

With these improvements, the conversion quality should reach 85-90%, making it suitable for high-quality ePub production that preserves the academic integrity and technical accuracy of the original research paper.
